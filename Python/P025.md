## This problem don't need programing

Fibonaci value in the place n caclculted bt `Fn=Fn-1 * ф` When ф is __1.618033988749895__\
So Fn=(Fn-2*ф)*ф and so on untill `Fn=(F1*ф)*ф*....*ф=Fn=ф^n-1` \
we need to fine the then where `Fn>10^999` or `ф^n-1>10^999` \

by some math, we can evaluate that 

```
n-1=(999*ln 10) /(ln 1.618033988749895)
where  ф=1.618033988749895
n-1=4780.18699481 
so 
n=4781.18699481 
```

this is the solution for `Fn>10^999` but n have to whole so --> __n=4782__
